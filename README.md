pnut.io logos
====================

![pnut logo](https://frankfuchs.net/pnut/images/positive.png)

**pnut.io** is a short-messaging social network. The messages have a limited
length, and you can follow folks, and be followed by folks. It's similar to
App.net and Twitter.

The utility of pnut.io is its extensibility. You will need an app from a
developer to do even the simplest things (creating a post!), but developers
have the potential to build programs that let you do more creative things,
too.

### Be part of the community

I wanted to contribute to the service. So I designed a logo.

My idea is to combine the peanut, which is how pnut (/ˈpiːˌnʌt/) is
pronounced, and a message bubble, as pnut is mainly a short-messaging social
network. pnut.io is also some more, but this is even not unpresented, as
you'll find more if you remove the peanut's shell _(a lame metaphor is better
than no metaphor. At least I hope so)_.

The logo makes use of Christian Robertson's [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab).
